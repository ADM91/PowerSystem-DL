# PowerSystem-RL
This project uses reinforcement learning to teach agents optimal action sequences on small scale power systems after a fault.

## Dependencies ##

* pypower
* networkx
* matplotlib
* numpy

## Methods of RL that will (optimistically) be investigated ##

* Cross-entropy method (CEM)
* Policy Gradient (PG)
* Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
* Actor Critic Agents (AC, A3C)
