# PowerSystem-DL #
This project aims to explore deep learning (DL) methods on power system restoration at the transmission level.

A restoration simulator is built at the core of the project and serves as the environment with which the DL agent
interacts.  The simulator is built in as general a way as possible so that any amount of system degradation can take place before restoration intervention takes over.  The optimal power flow (OPF) is solved using the Matpower6.0 toolbox.  A standing phase angle constraint before line reconnection is implemented.
